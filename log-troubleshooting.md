# Log Troubleshooting Notes
When investigating a technical issue, I focus on understanding what happened, when it happened, and what changed before it happened.
## What I look for
- Error messages
- Warning messages
- Timeouts
- Authentication failures
- Permission errors
- Service crashes
## Goal
Turn raw logs into clear, reproducible explanations that engineers and customers can act on.
