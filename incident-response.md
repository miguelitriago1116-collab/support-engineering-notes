# Incident Response Notes
When a production issue occurs:
- Gather details from users and logs  
- Determine impact and severity  
- Identify what changed  
- Coordinate with engineering  
- Communicate clearly to customers  
- Document what happened  
The goal is not just to fix the issue, but to ensure it does not happen again.
