# Git Basics for Support Engineers
These notes cover how Git is used to view, track, and suggest changes to code and documentation.
## Common commands
git clone     download a repository  
git status    see what changed  
git pull      get latest updates  
git diff      view differences  
git log       view history  
## Why this matters
Support Engineers use Git to inspect how features work, understand recent changes, and suggest improvements to documentation or tooling when customer issues are discovered.
