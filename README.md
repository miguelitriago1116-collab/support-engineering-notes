# support-engineering-notes
This repository contains learning notes, troubleshooting references, and small scripts created while building hands-on experience in SaaS support engineering.
It focuses on:
- Reading and interpreting logs
- Understanding Linux system behavior
- Basic Git workflows
- Troubleshooting and reproducing issues
- Turning real-world problems into documentation
This reflects the type of work I do in professional support environments: understanding what broke, why it broke, and how to explain it clearly so it can be fixed and prevented.
