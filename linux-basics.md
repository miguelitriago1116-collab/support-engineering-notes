# Linux Basics for Support Engineers
These notes document the Linux commands and concepts I use while learning how to troubleshoot SaaS platforms that run on Linux servers.
## Common commands
ls      list files  
cd      change directory  
pwd     show current directory  
cat     display file contents  
less    read large files  
grep    search inside files  
df -h   check disk space  
free -m check memory  
top     view running processes  
## Why this matters
Most modern SaaS platforms run on Linux. Support Engineers need to locate logs, verify services, and confirm system state when diagnosing customer issues.
