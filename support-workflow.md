# Support Engineering Workflow
This is the process I follow when diagnosing customer issues.
1. Understand the reported problem  
2. Reproduce the issue if possible  
3. Check logs and system state  
4. Identify the root cause  
5. Apply or suggest a fix  
6. Document the outcome  
7. Prevent the issue from recurring  
This mirrors how modern SaaS support teams work with engineering and product teams.
